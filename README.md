# mynet

**mynet** is a personal deep learning research project focused on implementing and training neural networks from scratch (with minimal libraries) on classic datasets such as **MNIST** and **ESC-50**.  
The goal is to explore the behavior of different architectures, activation functions, and optimization strategies in small to medium-scale deep learning experiments.
